# Changelog

## 2.3.0

All tests passing.

* Fixed a bug affecting the use of `arrangeFields` in modules that extend another module's use of `arrangeFields`. Added unit test based directly on a real-world project.
* `baseUrl` project-wide option added, yielding the same benefit as in 0.5: you get absolute URLs for all pages everywhere. (If you don't want absolute URLs, just don't set it.) This is very beneficial when generating `og:meta` tags for Facebook, or generating emails.
* A direct link to the original file has been added to the file manager's editor modal.

## 2.2.2

All tests passing.

* Addition of slugs to projection for autocomplete is now done in a way that still allows overrides at the doc level to add other properties.
* Addition of slugs to projection for autocomplete works for joins with a specific page type, too.
* Fixed a chicken-and-egg problem in the global module that kicked in if the "global" doc contains widgets powered by modules not yet initialized at the time the global module checks for the existence of the doc.

## 2.2.1

All tests passing.

Fixed an oversight: the new `pageBeforeCopy` global method now takes `req` as its first parameter. Since `2.2.0` was first published 5 minutes ago and this method has not yet been documented this is not regarded as a bc break.

## 2.2.0

All tests passing.

* Fixed bug that broke removal of permissions for pages.
* "Copy Page" feature added to the page menu.
* Automatically reposition the autocomplete dropdown for joins if it would collide with the bottom of the window.
* Include page slugs in the autocomplete dropdown for joins with pages.
* `chooserChoiceBase.html` restored; some projects were depending on extending it, which is a useful technique.

## 2.1.5

All tests passing.

* Admin bar: previously grouped fields can be re-grouped successfully, so concatenating admin bar configuration works just as well as concatenating `addFields` arrays
* Files widget displays upload button in the same user-friendly position as the images widget
* Font size for tabs and help labels is explicit to avoid side effects from project-level CSS

## 2.1.4

All tests passing.

* Previously chosen items that now reside in the trash no longer break the chooser for editing joins
* All joins editable; certain edge cases weren't getting blessed
* A field appears properly when two diferent choices list it for `showFields`
* As in 0.5, a required field hidden by `showFields` is not required (but will be if you elect the choice that shows it)

## 2.1.3

All tests passing.

* A typo in the unit tests caused unit tests to fail. This has been fixed.
* The recent addition of the HTML5 doctype caused the login page to be invisible in the sandbox project (not the boilerplate project). This has been fixed.
* The recent addition of the HTML5 doctype caused the admin bar to appear with a slight visual defect. This has been fixed.

## 2.1.2

Fix for [#668](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/issues/668), crash occurring when admin bar group leader starts out too close to the end of the admin bar items array.

## 2.1.1

Full Windows compatibility restored. The "recursively copy asset folders if on Windows" behavior from 0.5 was reimplemented. This is necessary to allow Apostrophe to run as a non-administrator on Windows. Running as administrator is the moral equivalent of running as root on Linux, which we would never recommend.

Since Apostrophe did not function previously on Windows and there is no behavior change on Mac/Linux this is effectively a bug fix rather than a new feature, thus 2.1.1.

## 2.1.0

* Introduced the new `apos.areas.richText` and `apos.areas.plaintext` methods, which are also available in templates by the same names.

* Added and documented the `addImageSizes` option of the `apostrophe-attachments` module.

## 2.0.4

* The `apostrophe-login` module now invokes `loginAfterLogin(req, callback)` on all modules that have such a method, via `apos.callAll`. Modules that do not need a callback can supply this method with only one argument. Afterwards, `apostrophe-login` redirects to `req.redirect`, as is supported elsewhere in Apostrophe. So you can assign to `req.redirect` in your callback to change the user's destination after a successful login. If `req.redirect` is not set, the user is redirected to the home page.

## 2.0.3

The `ancestors` and `children` filters defaulted to `areas(false)`, but `joins(false)` was omitted, contrary to documentation which has always indicated the information returned is limited for performance. This was fixed. You can still override freely with the `filters` option to `apostrophe-pages`.

The HTML5 doctype was added to `outerLayoutBase`. HTML5 was always assumed, and the absence of the doctype broke jQuery's support for distinguishing `$(window).height()` from `$(document).height()`, causing runaway infinite scroll loading.

Warning message instructions for configuring the session secret were fixed (the actual location has not changed).

## 2.0.2

Previously the `contextual` flag of a pieces module was not considered before deciding to redirect to the "show page" for the piece, which might not exist. This has been fixed. It should only happen when the module has `contextual: true`, creating a reasonable expectation that such a page must exist.

## 2.0.1

Packaging and documentation issues only.

## 2.0.0

Inaugural npm release of Apostrophe 2.x, which was used prior to that in many projects via git dependencies.
