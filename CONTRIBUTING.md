Of course, we welcome traditional open source contributions via pull requests
and new open issues to our GitHub repository. If youâ€™d like to dig in right away
see issues with the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
and ["good first issue"](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labels.

## Reporting a Bug

If you come across a bug, please submit an issue in the GitHub repo. Thatâ€™s the
primary source for bug documentation, so first be sure to search the existing
issues and make sure it hasnâ€™t been logged. If it hasnâ€™t, please include the
following details as they apply:

1. Steps to reproduce the bug.
2. The expected behavior and actual behavior.
3. Screenshots or animated .GIFs to help illustrate the behavior.
4. Code samples.

Finally, remember to attach the `bug` label to the issue, to help use stay
organized.

Bonus: Although not required, if you write a test that reproduces the bug you
found, and submit that failing test as a PRâ€¦ well, we might even send you some
swag ðŸ˜‰.

If you're not sure that it's a bug or a problem in your code, you can post and
find answers to support questions about ApostropheCMS in
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apostrophe-cms) or
[Discord](https://chat.apostrophecms.org).

## Suggesting a Feature or Enhancement

We also track feature requests and larger scale enhancements within the GitHub
repository. After a search of existing issues to confirm your idea is unique,
please feel free to submit your idea as a new issue. Remember to include details
that articulate the current functionality and how this enhancement will improve
or build upon that. Attaching images to illustrate your feature is often useful.

Adding the label of `enhancement` along with categorizing your issue with an
existing label such as `UI`, `UX`, `accessibility`, `security`, etc. will help
the core maintainers stay organized and is greatly appreciated.

## Fixing Bugs or Submitting Enhancements

If youâ€™ve perused our open issues labeled `bug` and decide to work to resolve
one, or youâ€™ve got a new feature that youâ€™d like to commit to the core project,
please keep these things in mind:

1. Make sure your pull request includes tests. [For examples of back-end unit
tests, look here](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/tree/master/test)
at the test folder of the apostrophe module. This level of coverage is expected
for backend features that aren't already covered by a test. For examples of
front-end, browser-based regression tests, [check out the
`apostrophe-enterprise-testbed` module](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-enterprise-testbed).
We don't expect that every contributor is ready to write Nightwatch tests like
these, but it is surely appreciated. If itâ€™s a bug fix you should have a test
that reproduces the issue (if you canâ€™t write a test for the bug you are
addressing, please note the reason why).
2. Run ESLint to be sure your update adheres to our coding standards. The
`apostrophe` module already has a `.eslintrc` file, so the simplest way is to
run: `npx eslint .` Your editor may automatically point out eslint-detected
concerns as well.
3. Enhancements should include documentation and include implementation details
were applicable.

## Should you make a new npm module?

Great question. If it's not a bug fix or an improvement to the core UI, it often
doesn't belong in the core `apostrophe` npm module. For instance, our blogging
functionality is in the separate `apostrophe-blog` npm module.

See [publishing your own npm modules for Apostrophe](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/apostrophe/other/more-modules#publishing-your-own-npm-modules-for-apostrophe) for more information.
